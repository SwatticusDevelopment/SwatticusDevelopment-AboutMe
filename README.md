# Professional Journey
As a newly minted FBI Cyber Operations Specialist and Special Agent, I've taken my passion for cybersecurity and development to serve at a federal level. With 12 years of coding experience starting from California roots, I've mastered 13 programming languages and continuously fuel my work with probably too much caffeine.
Currently juggling my FBI duties while leading development on an exciting AAA indie game project, plus maintaining my role as a full stack developer. My journey through tech has been diverse and unconventional â€“ exactly how I like it.
Current Projects & Focus
Several projects are keeping me busy in different sectors:
For the indie game studio, we're in active development of something special that I can't fully disclose yet. On the federal side, my cyber operations work involves cutting-edge security implementations and threat analysis. As a full stack developer, I'm pushing boundaries in both frontend and backend technologies.
Quarter 2-3 will see me launching a specialized Text To Speech project focused on accessibility for the disabled community. I'm also looking forward to diving into Nightingale modding once their Dev Kit releases.

# Technical Background
Started coding at age 10 in California, and haven't stopped since. My technical foundation includes:

- Deep expertise across 13 programming languages
- Professional experience in cybersecurity, game development, and full stack solutions
- Specialized background in audio engineering with unique hearing capabilities (sub-2db hearing range)
- Strong focus on security implementation and vulnerability assessment

While my work spans multiple industries, I maintain a special interest in creative coding projects that merge security with innovation. Whether it's developing secure gaming servers or implementing new cybersecurity solutions, I'm always pushing to expand my technical boundaries.
# Unique Traits

- Enhanced auditory perception (sub-2db hearing range)
- Active involvement in audio engineering and production
- Curated development music collection on Spotify
- Known to occasionally dream in code (yes, really!)
- Passionate about merging security with accessibility in tech

My development philosophy centers on security-first design while maintaining accessibility and user experience. With constant coffee in hand, I'm always ready for the next coding challenge.
