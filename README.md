# Who am I?
Well, I'm a developer who has been in many industries inside the coding realm and world. From cybersecurity, gaming, and software for the most part. Never once knowing what area I wanted to land in I have had specific focuses inside them all. Cybersecurity I worked through Hackerone, with multiple companies to support there SQLi and Text Injection problems. Gaming, has been a hobby since a child so I focus on Steam Modding through Unreal Engine 4 & 5. As well as I create Community and Streamer Servers for whoever I come across with a high level security throught he UE mods and server settings. Software has been a keen focus for me. Seeking out making a breach tool off the old LOIC program that was created so long ago. After 8 years and many testing on contracts and test networks I feel like Its stable enough to share. Developer with a software company. My focus on freelance, contracts, and asks are very limited. However wont stop me from helping, or continuing my projects.

# Any new projects in the next few quarters?
I have a few ideas of projects I will run past a few friends and fellow developers. However nothing inside the gaming realm sadly. I have mentioned I will be doing Nightingale Modding through their Dev Kit once released. However my primary focus is helping the disabled community only with a Text To Speech in the coming 2nd or 3rd quarter.
